# Tower Guides

Collection of tower guides used on the website.

These are totally open to improvement. If you see anything that needs to be changed, things that need to be added or removed, or even just spelling/grammar changes, you're free to make any changes to improve the quality for the next who come across the guides.

We're striving to make things as minimal as possible, and compose them, as we use the system, into easier and easier to use components (possibly with defaults, if we find them good).
